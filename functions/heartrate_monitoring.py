This example shows a readout of your heart rate in BPM (beats per
minute) and heartbeats detected using a heart emoticon <3.
It's best to hold the sensor against your fingertip (the fleshy side)
using a piece of wire or a rubber band looped through the mounting
holes on the breakout, as the sensor is very sensitive to small
movements and it's hard to hold your finger against the sensor with
even pressure.
If you're using your MAX30105 Breakout with Breakout Garden, then
we'd recommend using one of our Breakout Garden Extender Kits with
some female-to-female jumper jerky.
